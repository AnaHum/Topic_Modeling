# Topic_Modeling
In this project, I do Topic Modeling with Gensim and deploy the LDA model. For the data, I chose speeches delivered by Victor Orban who represents the Hungarian party Fidesz. I extracted the speeches from two main websites, where they were officially translated by the government. The speeches are mainly made in electoral periods, however, there are some exceptions as they were making the focuses of the political strategy of the party rather more clear. the timeframe of the data ranges from 2014 to 2018. 
Along with the LDA model, I also apply Sentiment Analysis methods on speeches, as well as Simpofioed Text Processing Method-Textblob.  All of these allowed me to detect the main topics politician focused on and to check the subjectivity and objectivity of those topics.
